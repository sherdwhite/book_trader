# Database Connection Pooling Configuration

This document explains the database connection pooling settings added to the BookTrader application.

## What is Connection Pooling?

Connection pooling manages database connections by:
- Reusing existing connections instead of creating new ones
- Maintaining a pool of active connections
- Closing idle connections after a timeout period

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

The following environment variables control database connection pooling:

- `DJANGO_ENV`: Set to `production` for production-level pooling settings
- `DB_CONN_MAX_AGE`: Connection lifetime in seconds (default: 300 for development, 600 for production)
- `DB_CONNECT_TIMEOUT`: Connection timeout in seconds (default: 10 for development, 30 for production)
- `DB_NAME`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`, `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`: Standard database connection settings

### Pool Settings

**Development (DJANGO_ENV=development or not set):**
- Connection max age: 300 seconds (5 minutes)
- Connection timeout: 10 seconds

**Production (DJANGO_ENV=production):**
- Connection max age: 600 seconds (10 minutes)
- Connection timeout: 30 seconds

## Usage

### Development
```bash
docker-compose up
```

### Production
```bash
# Using production settings with larger connection pool
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml up
```
## Monitoring

Monitor your connection pool and database health:

```bash
# Check database connectivity and Django health
python manage.py check --database default

# Monitor service health (includes database)
make health

# Check Docker service status
docker compose ps

# View database logs
docker compose logs db
```

### Health Checks

The application includes health checks:
- **Database**: `pg_isready -U postgres` (every 10 seconds)
- **Django**: `python manage.py check --database default` (every 30 seconds)
- **Recovery**: Unhealthy containers are restarted

# Monitor active connections (requires database access)
python manage.py dbshell
# Then run: SELECT count(*) FROM pg_stat_activity;
```
